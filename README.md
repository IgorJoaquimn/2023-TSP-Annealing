## Introduction

The Traveling Salesman problem is a classic optimization challenge. Its relevance is undeniable, due to its application in a wide range of fields, and its complexity is notorious, since it is classified as NP-hard. In essence, the problem involves finding the shortest route that allows you to visit a set of cities once and return to the city of origin, based on the distances between the cities.

The main objective of this work was to compare the performance of Simulated Annealing in different scenarios, varying the number of cities, the distribution of the cities and the complexity of the problem instances. The results obtained made it possible to evaluate Simulated Annealing's ability to deal with the Traveling Salesman problem and provided valuable insights into the influence of the chosen parameters on the method's performance.
